api/      - The code for the high-level wrapper API. Not needed if
            you use the lowel-level call-back/raw API.

core/     - The core of the TPC/IP stack; protocol implementations,
            memory and buffer management, and the low-level raw API.

include/  - lwIP include files.

netif/    - Generic network interface device drivers are kept here,
            as well as the ARP module.
		etharp.c
				  Implements the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) over
				  Ethernet. The code in this file should be used together with
				  Ethernet device drivers. Note that this module has been
				  largely made Ethernet independent so you should be able to
				  adapt this for other link layers (such as Firewire).

		ethernetif.c
				  An example of how an Ethernet device driver could look. This
				  file can be used as a "skeleton" for developing new Ethernet
				  network device drivers. It uses the etharp.c ARP code.
				  ->in CubeMX same file was used. NON-Edited

		loopif.c
				  A "loopback" network interface driver. It requires configuration
				  through the define LWIP_LOOPIF_MULTITHREADING (see opt.h).

		slipif.c
				  A generic implementation of the SLIP (Serial Line IP)
				  protocol. It requires a sio (serial I/O) module to work.

		ppp/      Point-to-Point Protocol stack
				  The PPP stack has been ported from ucip (http://ucip.sourceforge.net).
				  It matches quite well to pppd 2.3.1 (http://ppp.samba.org), although
				  compared to that, it has some modifications for embedded systems and
				  the source code has been reordered a bit.
				  
				  
Each subdirectory (may) also include:

perf.c     - Optional file that should be implemented when running
             performance tests of lwIP.

sys.c      - Implementation of the operating system emulation layer.

include/   - Architectural specific header files.

netif/     - Architectural specific network interfaces.
